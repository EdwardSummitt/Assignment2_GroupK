/*
The program will ask the user to provide the file path of the orders.csv spreadsheet and then constructs an AVL tree with it. After having received a valid file, the program then provides a numbered list of each operation that the user can perform and will be asked to input a number corresponding to the operation they want to carry out. Adding a book order will prompt the user for an order ID and a book name, which it will then insert into the AVL tree using the insert() function. Removing one asks for the order ID, searches for the order using the ID, prints out the name, and removes it using the delete() function. Asking for an in-order list uses the inOrderTraveral() function to traverse the tree from the smallest to the largest order number and prints out every element. Finding the name of a specific book based off the book number asks the user for the order number and searches the tree and prints out the corresponding book name. Finding the oldest and latest book numbers uses the findMinOrder() and findMaxOrder() functions respectively to find the minimum and maximum values in the tree, which correspond to the oldest and latest entry. Choosing "exit" terminates the while loop showing the user options. Both the insert() and delete() functions check the balance factor of the new tree that results from either operation and rotates it accordingly.
